Outdoor posters & vinyls, leaflet drops, and maps were created and distributed in order to promote a trail of 21 of the world's most inspirational buildings recreated in LEGO, as well as an Interactive Building Zone, Mosaic Builds and a variety of LEGO-related fringe events, deals and competitions.",
                "When the event opened it was all about the Interactive Companion Trail Guide App. Download it and GPS-based tracking features guided you to each of the LEGO models on the trail, provided information on both the brick and real landmarks, and logged your Trail progress. All of which could be updated remotely throughout the fortnight.",
                "At launch, the App instantly became the No.1 trending Event App on Google's Play Store and remained in the top 3 for the duration of the event."

And the competition is actually very good - items are well made from baby-soft materials and packaging is all environmentally friendly, etc, etc. A USP and competitive edge based on quality was immediately off the table.",
            "We continued our research looking for another angle and it came after our Creative Director's children made him take an impromptu visit McDonalds. Whilst looking at a table of half eaten burgers and untouched fries he understood the kids only wanted the toys, not the food. Here was our differentiator - design the brand and the clothing so the kids want it as much as the adults, if not more.",
            "From this point on, everything was designed to appeal to children. A simple illustration style was created by artist Geo Law which saw spacemen and princesses on t-shirts and cute woodland animals on wellies. Throw in some additional client-inspired touches like packaging that turns into Ludwig the brand owl and Poco Nido was born (even the name was developed with monosyllabic-style baby speech in mind).",
            "The results have seen Poco Nido win a clutch of awards, acquire listings in boutiques across the globe, and operate their increasingly successful consumer and retail e-commerce sites from offices in the UK and Singapore. Who'd have thought a free Disney toy could have started all that?"

Locations ranged from urban parks to industrial cross-fit gyms to isolated spots in the Peak District.",
